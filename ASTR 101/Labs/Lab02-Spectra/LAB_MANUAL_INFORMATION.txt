Introduction:

Due to the quantum nature of light, it behaves simultaneously like a wave (defined by
quantities such as wavelength, frequency and speed), and like a stream of massless particles,
or packets of energy called photons. For the sake of this lab exercise, we will only be
focussing on the wavelike nature of light.
The wavelength of a wave is the distance between consecutive "peaks" or "crests". The
wavelength of visible light is short, and is usually measured in nanometres (1 nm = 10^¬Ø9 m
or angstroms (1 angstrom =  10^¬Ø10 m). The wavelength of light determines its colour, as perceived
by the eye. Red light has a wavelength of around 6500 √Ö, green light of about 5000 √Ö, and
blue light of about 4500 √Ö. The human eye responds to wavelengths in the range of about
4000-7000 √Ö. A given wavelength of light corresponds to a particular energy for the photons;
higher energies have shorter (bluer) wavelengths.
Every type of atom every element can be thought of as a cloud of electrons orbiting a
central nucleus. These electrons exist in various energy states. Transitions to and from these
energy states require specific amounts of energy (the "quantum" in quantum physics), which
either release or absorb energy in the form of a photon of the corresponding wavelength.
A spectrum (plural spectra) is the measurement of the relative intensity of light at different
wavelengths (or energies). Broadly, there are three types of spectral features:

Continuum : A spectrum with smoothly varying intensity across a continuous mix of wave-
lengths (as opposed to large excesses or deficits of intensity at particular wavelengths).
You will typically see continuum emission where you have a hot, dense source, such
as an incandescent lightbulb, or the surface of a star. One special type of continuum
spectrum is a called a blackbody, which has a particular kind of continuum spec-
trum with a broad peak in intensity. We typically see blackbody spectra from the
surface of stars. The overall intensity of a blackbody source increases sharply with in-
creasing temperature (Stefan-Boltzmann law) which also corresponds to shorter peak
wavelengths (Wien's law). Hotter blackbodies are always bluer, and for two otherwise
similar blackbodies, the hotter one will be brighter.

Emission Line : When an electron in an atom moves from a high energy state to a lower
energy, it will emit a photon with a wavelength equivalent to the change in energy.
This can be the source of emission of many photons of the same wavelength, so there
will be a sharp peak in intensity at that particular wavelength. This can appear as
a bright emission line over a faint (or non-existent) continuum. This type of feature
appears when you have a hot, diffuse gas along your line of sight. The spectra from the
discharge tubes which you will be observing for this lab exercise are emission spectra.

Absorption Line : When an electron is promoted from a lower to a higher energy state,
it will absorb a photon with a wavelength equivalent to that energy. Therefore, when
light passes through a cool gas, the electrons in the gas absorb many photons of the
same wavelength. This removes radiation of a certain wavelength from the spectrum,
so there is a sharp dip in intensity or absorption at that particular wavelength. This
can appear as a dark bar on a continuum spectrum. You see this type of spectrum
when light from a continuum source passes through a cool, diffuse gas along the line
of sight.

Because the number and arrangement of electrons for each element is different, every element
has its own unique and distinct combination of specific energies it requires to change the state
of its electrons, and therefore, its own unique combination of spectral lines. The emission
and absorption spectra for a particular element (or molecule) consist of the exact same
wavelengths. A specific emission line of hydrogen from a hot, diffuse, nebula will be the
same wavelength as the corresponding hydrogen absorption line from the atmosphere of a
star.
Therefore, astronomers can determine which elements are present by observing the lines that
are present in light coming from stars or interstellar gas, and thus understand the detailed
chemical make-up of these extremely distant objects without ever needing a sample from
them! While chemists need samples to do their chemical analysis, astronomers do their
chemical analysis just using the light collected by their telescopes!!
Astronomers use the relative strengths of the spectral lines, measured with their equivalent
widths in the spectrum taken from a mixture of elements to estimate the relative amounts
of different elements in that mixture. We thus accurately know the chemical make-up of the
Sun, other stars, interstellar medium, distant galaxies, and so on. We can use these same
techniques to soon be able to see what elements are in the atmospheres of planets around
other stars by observing their absorption lines, and thus perhaps see the first signatures of
life elsewhere in the Universe! These are only a few applications of spectroscopy ‚Äî spectrum measurements ‚Äî in astronomy. Spectroscopy, the analysis of the spectra of elements is
therefore an essential tool for an astronomer.
One way to observe a spectrum is to split up light from a source by wavelength so that
different colours hit a detector at different locations for measurement. Splitting up light by
wavelength can be done in several ways, for instance with water droplets in the air (rainbow),
with a glass prism, or with a grating which has finely spaced, ruled lines. For this lab, we
will use such a diffraction grating, which is a special film of plastic on which there are 600
parallel lines accurately etched on every millimeter of the film.
In the first two parts of this lab, you will be exploring the spectra of various sources. In the
third part, you will be using images taken by a diffraction grating attached to a webcam as
a spectrograph to determine the exact wavelengths of three emission lines of Hydrogen.

Spectrographs
Diffraction gratings are particularly suited for scientific measurements as they spread light
out linearly. That is, the amount that each wavelength of light is spread out on the detector
is directly proportional to its wavelength.

For a spectral observation, light from the target passes through a slit in the spectroscope,
passes through (or is reflected by) the grating, and the resulting spectrum is imaged by the
detector. The spectrum will appear in the image as a bright central peak (the image of the
source) with the colours of the spectrum spread to either side. However, we are looking at
a picture. How can we relate what we see in the picture to actual wavelengths?
For a diffraction grating spectroscope, the separation between the central peak and individual
emission (or absorption) lines on the detector (ùë•) is related to their wavelengths (Œª) via:
(1)	Œª = m(ùë•)+b
That is, the equation of a line with slope m and intercept b. In order to determine the values
of the constants m and b, astronomers need to calibrate their spectrograph by imaging a
source with known wavelengths. This is typically an arc lamp filled with a specific gas
mixture.
As part of this lab, you will be using a Helium discharge tube as a calibration source for a
webcam spectrograph, and using the calibration to determine the wavelengths of the first
three Hydrogen Balmer lines.

Data Collection:
Part I: Visual observation of different types of spectra
Normally, for this part of the lab, we observe the spectra of different light sources using the
handheld diffraction grating. Instead the spectra for different light sources and for different
chemical elements have been recorded and are shown in Figures 1 ‚Äî 4. Your TAs will explain
these spectra during the lab class, and outline the lab work you need to complete. The four
kinds of sources are:
1. Incandescent light bulb with varying input power
2. Sunlight,
3. Fluorescent lamp,
4. Gas discharge tubes.
Further details of each type and images are given below:
1. Incandescent lamp with varying input power
In the incandescent lamp, light is emitted by a tungsten wire heated by electricity to high
temperature. The power input to the light bulb can be varied, so the temperature of the
wire may be increased or decreased. In order to study the spectrum of this light source,
the light is passed through a diffraction grating and recorded with a camera. In the case
of the incandescent lamp, since the light source is a heated metal, we observe a continuum
spectrum. The power input is set to a low value first, and the spectrum is recorded. The
power input is then increased to its maximum, and the spectrum is recorded again. The two
spectra shown below are for low and high power settings of the lamp. The dark, horizontal
bars seen in each image are shadows cast by the filament supports in the bulb, and are not
spectral features.
Figure 1: Low (top) and high power (bottom) continuum spectra from the incandescent
lamp photographed with a handheld diffraction grating and DSLR camera. The spectra are
shown with shorter wavelengths (violet) on the left, and longer wavelengths (red, NIR) on the
right. The horizontal lines are shadows caused by the filament supports in the light bulb and
are not spectral features. This particular DSLR camera is intended for astrophotography,
so the peachy-orange colour to the right of the red in the spectrum is actually
near-IR wavelengths.
Include the images of the incandescent bulb spectra in the data section of your
lab report, and answer the following:
1. Compare the high and low power incandescent spectra. How are they different? Ex-
plain in your own words the reasons for the differences you notice related to the overall
brightness of both spectra, as well as the colors seen in each of them. It may help to
annotate the images.
2. Sunlight
Sunlight is a good example of an absorption spectrum combined with a continuum spectrum.
Dark lines in the spectrum of the Sun were first recorded by William Hyde Wollaston in the
early 19th century, and were mapped in detail a decade later by Joseph von Fraunhofer.
Fraunhofer identified over 500 unique lines and labelled the most prominent of them with
the letters A-K. As a result, the solar absorption lines are typically called "Fraunhofer lines".
Deep in the core of the Sun, vast amounts of energy are produced by fusion. The energy
propagates outward through the layers of the Sun until it reaches the photosphere, the last
layer where the gas is opaque (the solar "surface"). The energy escapes the photosphere
as light and passes through layers of transparent cooler gas. The extremely high tempera-
ture and opacity of the photosphere produces a continuum spectrum. As this light passes
through the cooler gas, the gas absorbs light at certain wavelengths depending on its chemical
composition. This creates the absorption lines in the spectrum.
Since the spectrum of each chemical element is unique, astronomers can estimate the chemi-
cal composition of the gas from these absorption lines. In addition, by measuring the depth
and width of these lines, scientists can estimate how much of each element is present, the temperature, gravitational force and many other physical properties of the star. A photo-
graph of the solar spectrum is shown in Figure 2. This photograph was taken by pointing
the camera and grating at a narrow slit in the blinds of a window.
Figure 2: A photograph of the solar spectrum taken with the DSLR camera and handheld
diffraction grating, with wavelengths increasing from left to right. The absorption lines are
the vertical features. This image has been squashed vertically for display purposes; the full
resolution version is in the .zip file.
Include the image of the solar spectrum in your lab report's data section:
2. Annotate the image to point out the "peak" brightness (i.e., the colour that appears
the brightest), and indicate 5 or 6 prominent absorption lines in the image. Note:
only the vertical features are absorption lines. Any horizontal bands are caused by
shadows behind the slit, not absorption features.
3. Compare the lines you indicated to the diagram on Brightspace that shows the Fraun-
hofer lines. For each line, match it to the diagram and explain what element it comes
from and whether it is solar or terrestrial in origin.

3. Fluorescent Lamp
Fluorescent lamps are commonly used for household lighting. In a fluorescent lamp, the
atoms of a gas (common ones are mercury vapour, sodium vapour, and neon) in a glass tube
are excited by electrical current. This causes the electrons in the atoms to jump between
energy levels and emit light only at certain wavelengths which are typical for that gas.
To convert this to useful light (either white or colored), which is pleasing to our eyes, the
glass tube is coated with fluorescent coating (the white coating seen inside the glass). This
coating absorbs the photons and re-emits them at different wavelengths. This is particularly
important for fluorescent tubes containing mercury vapour, as mercury emits most of its
energy at extreme UV wavelengths. The fluorescent coating converts that harmful energy
into safer wavelengths that we can use to see.
In Figure 3, the spectrum of a fluorescent lamp taken with the diffraction grating is shown.
Include the photograph of the fluorescent lamp spectrum in your data section:
4. In the spectrum of the fluorescent lamp, you can see a continuum spectrum as well as
bright, colored lines corresponding to an emission spectrum. Annotate the image to
point out the emission lines and continuum.
5. Explain why you see both types of spectra in fluorescent lamps.

Figure 3: A photograph of fluorescent lamp spectrum taken with the DSLR camera and
handheld diffraction grating, with wavelengths increasing from left to right. The spectrum
from the fluorescent lamp shows a combination of an emission spectrum superposed on a
continuum spectrum.
4. Discharge Tubes
Discharge tubes are similar to fluorescent lamps as they are glass tubes filled with gas,
across which a voltage is applied. Discharge tubes lack the fluorescent coating, meaning
that the light we see from these tubes is purely from the gas's emission spectrum (though
discharge tubes intended for scientific demonstration will have a coating that blocks harmful
UV emission). Figure 4 shows the emission spectra for six "mystery" elements.
At the following website, an online app is available to generate the spectrum of all the
elements: https : // sites . google . com/view/linespectrabydralanj ircitano/home
For each of the six images in Figure 4:
6. Use the app to identify the element pictured. For each identification, include a screen-
shot of the element in the app (you can click on the symbol at the top right to pop out
the image of the spectrum and download it). Explain how you identified the element.
It may be useful to annotate your screenshot to indicate the lines that drove your
identification.

To help narrow your search, here is a list of possible elements (along with proper chemical
names as used in the periodic table):
Argon (Ar)
‚Ä¢ Hydrogen (H)
‚Ä¢ Helium (He)
Oxygen (O)
Mercury (Hg)
Nitrogen (N)
‚Ä¢ Iron (Fe)
Uranium (U)
Neon (Ne)
Sodium (Na)

Figure 4: Emission spectra of six different chemical elements, in visible wavelengths. In
visible light, blue lines are shorter wavelengths (‚Äî higher frequency, higher energy), green
is intermediate, and red lines are longer wavelengths and lower energy. Notice the distinct
spectral lines in each spectrum, which permits them to be clearly identified by their spectral
fingerprints. (Note: These spectra were taken with a higher resolution spectrograph so that
the spectral lines are clearly seen.)

Part 11: Blackbody Continuum Spectra
The spectrum of the Sun shows a continuum spectrum superimposed with absorption lines.
Naturally, spectra of other stars are similar. As mentioned in the introduction, the thermal
continuum emission from the surface of stars is well-approximated by a blackbody.
We will be using this demo from PhET to explore the properties of blackbody continuum
emission: https : // phet . colorado . edu/sims/html/blackbody-spectrum/latest/bla
ckbody- spectrum_en. html. In the simulation, check the boxes for "Graph Values" and
"Labels". The overall colour of the star is indicated by the "star" above the graph.
Use the demo to fill in Table 1. For each star in the table, record the peak wavelength of
the spectrum in A, what the colour of that peak wavelength is (if outside the visible range,
indicate UV or IR), and the overall colour of the star. Include this table in the data section
of your lab report.
Convert the wavelengths from to by multiplying by 10 000.

Part Ill: Spectrograph Calibration
In this part of the lab exercise, you will use recorded spectra of Helium and Hydrogen to
experience how astronomers identify the chemical elements present in stars using their unique
'spectral fingerprints', and also measure many important physical properties.
Normally, in the lab class, you would use a spectrograph (grating + camera) to record the
spectra and make these measurements. For the sake of this lab exercise, the spectra have
been taken and provided to you. Both the high-resolution versions of the images are included
in the .zip file. Your TA will demonstrate how to make the measurements using GIMP.
Using the recorded spectra, you will measure the relative positions of their spectral lines, and
thus determine the wavelengths by replicating the spectral calibration process astronomers
use. In this exercise, we will be using helium as the "known" spectrum, and hydrogen as the
"unknown".
NOTE: You will need to download and install GIMP on your computer for this part of lab
exercise. Refer to the installation instructions on Brightspace. If you are not able to install
Measure the Pixel Separations of the Lines
In this step you will determine the conversion between the observed pixel positions of the
spectral lines and their actual wavelengths. This is usually referred as the wavelength cali-
bration of the spectrograph. Figure 5 shows the annotated image of the Helium spectrum
to help you identify the lines, and Table 2 lists the lines with their corresponding wave-
lengths. Notice that the red lines have longer wavelengths (N 6678 A) than the violet lines
(N 3889 A). The zeroth order spectrum (direct image of the source) and the fainter second
order spectrum are also shown.
Digital cameras are made up of grids of square pixels, which represent the dimensions of
the image. Therefore, we can determine the calibration by plotting a graph of the known
wavelengths vs. the pixel separations for Helium. We will be measuring the pixel separations,
in GIMP (Gnu Image Nlanipulation Program).
1. Open the Helium spectrum image in GIMP.
2. In the GIMP menu bar, to Tools > Measure to select the measurement tool. Once you
have done this, a compass icon should show up in the Toolbox. You can click on this
icon to reselect the measurement tool (or just type the letter m while holding the SHIFT
key) if you accidentally change tools.
3. Click and hold on the zeroth-order line, and drag the mouse while holding CTRL to
draw a straight measurement. Release the mouse when you reach the first emission
line (Line 8 in Figure 5). You can edit the endpoints of the measurement once they
are placed; just remember to hold CTRL to keep the line horizontal.
4. The length of the measurement will appear in the bar at the bottom of the main GIMP
window. Record this number in Table 2 for Line 8.
5. Repeat the measurements for the other Helium lines listed in the table. You can leave
one endpoint of your measurement fixed on the "zeroth" order line and drag the other
endpoint to the other lines.
6. Open the hydrogen image and repeat the above steps for the three hydrogen Balmer lines (Figure 6), recording your line positions in Table 3.
7. Use the measurement tool to measure the width of the zero-th order line in the hydrogen
spectrum, and divide that measurement by 2. This will be the uncertainty in your line
position measurements for hydrogen, AT.
Calibrate the Spectrograph
Now that we have the line position measurements, we can use Helium to determine the
relationship between line position and wavelength.
Make a plot of Wavelength in √Ö vs line position in pixels for Helium. You can
either draw this by hand on graph paper, or use plotting software such as Microsoft Excel
Figure 5: The Helium lamp spectrum in black and white with the eight principal spectral
lines, listed in Table 2 shown annotated. The lines labelled 5,4 are two closely spaced blue-
green lines indicated as left and right in Table 2. The zeroth order spectrum (reference point
for measurements) and the faint second order spectrum are also shown.

or Google Sheets (or your software of choice). We have provided an optional Excel template
on Brightspace if you want to go this route. Refer back to the Graph and Table Guidelines
for best results in your lab report.
If you drew your graph by hand:
Draw a line of best fit through the points.
For each of the line separations in Table 3, draw a vertical line on the graph at the
corresponding pixel position to where it intersects with your best fit line.
For each of the points of intersection with your best fit line, draw a horizontal line
connecting it to the y-axis.
Read off the value where each horizontal line intersects the y-axis, and record that
value in the "Wavelength" column of Table 3.
If you used the computer:
Your software should have an option to add a "trendline" to the graph. This is your
best fit line.
Determine the slope and y-intercept of the line (m and b in equation (1)). Your software
will have an option to show the equation of your trendline. Alternatively, you can use
the LINEST function in the spreadsheet. Either of these methods will give you the
slope (m) and y-intercept (b) of your line. Don't forget to state them in your data
section if you used this method.
Calculate equation (1) for each of the three hydrogen lines and record the values in the
Wavelength column of Table 3.
Don't forget to attach this graph to the data section of your lab report.

Analysis
Address the following points in the Analysis section of your report:
Spectral Features
(1) Briefly explain what causes each type of spectral feature seen in each of the sources
in Part I, and what it tells us about the underlying conditions (e.g. temperature,
density) of each source. Your TA will help by pointing out features and offering some
explanation.
(2) When examining the Fraunhofer lines, most of them were solar in origin, but some
were also terrestrial (from Earth). Why would these lines be present in our photo of
the solar spectrum, and what causes them?
Blackbody Continuum Spectra
These questions are based on the results of the PhET Simulation.
(3) Using some research, find out what type of star Betelgeuse is. Does the color you
determined from the simulation match the expected color of the star, based on its
type?
(4) What is the spectral type of the star, Sirius? Explain whether or not the color you
determined from the simulation matches the expected color based on the star's spectral
type?
(5) Does the peak wavelength you determined for the Sun agree with the peak wavelength
evident in our picture of the solar spectrum (Figure 2)? Explain.
(6) Based on your observations of the blackbody curve, why don't we see green stars even
when the star's peak wavelength is green?
Spectral Calibration
(7) Determine the uncertainty in your hydrogen line wavelengths. Show your work.
‚Ä¢ If you drew the graph by hand: choose one of the lines and find the wavelength
(N) of x' = x + Ax (position + uncertainty). Subtract your original wavelength
value to get the uncertainty: N ‚Äî
‚Ä¢ If you used the computer: multiply your Ax value by the slope of your line:
Discussion
Your discussion should address the following in addition to the relevant points in the Lab
Report Guidelines:
The accepted values for the hydrogen lines you measured are 6563 for I-lcm, 4861
for H/3, and 4340 for 1-17. Do your values agree within error? (i.e., is the difference
between your value and the accepted value smaller than AA?). How far off are they?
What are some of the factors that may have affected your results?
Applying what you have learned, how might spectroscopy be used to learn about
extrasolar planet atmospheres? Your answer should include:
The conditions under which you could observe such a spectrum,
What type of spectrum it would be, and
What makes this type of observation particularly challenging?
