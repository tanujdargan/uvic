# <a name="_toc142662811"></a>Course Description and Overview
## <a name="_toc142662812"></a>Calendar Description
Practice of skills needed for successful academic writing in a variety of subject areas. Analysis of rhetorical, stylistic, research, and documentation techniques; development of these techniques through practical writing assignments. Balance of lectures and discussion. 

## <a name="_toc142662813"></a>Course and Section Overview
ATWP135 will enable you to build on the reading and writing skills you have developed in the classroom, your communities, and the workplace to progress toward another level of literacy that we hope will help you navigate communication situations more effectively.

ATWP135 will help you develop the core transferable skills in critical thinking, reading, and writing that you will use in your university courses, regardless of your program of studies. Through the analysis of a variety of readings, you will discover the characteristics and conventions used by scholars in different disciplines. You will explore different genres of academic writing and how these reflect different rhetorical purposes. You will practise typical academic writing tasks, including writing a basic research paper, and will learn strategies for reading and writing more effectively as well as for approaching new writing tasks. Through peer review, drafting, revision, and reflection, you will learn that writing is an ongoing process.

# <a name="_toc142662824"></a>Course and University Policies
##
## <a name="_toc142662825"></a>University of Victoria Communicable Disease Safety Plan
For updated news on University of Victoria plans, please see the [Communicable Disease Safety Plan](https://www.uvic.ca/ohse/covid19/communicable-disease-plan/index.php).

Continue to do a daily health self-assessment, and if you are ill or have new or worsening COVID symptoms, please stay home.

Masks are not required but are still strongly encouraged on campus in indoor public spaces.

Rapid antigen tests are available at the UVic Bookstore and at Campus Security.

**If I need to self-isolate or take time off due to illness**, then you are expected to use our online site for this period of time. Of course, I encourage you to use the site to review materials even when we are face-to-face. I will keep you informed via email and the course site if I do need to isolate. None of us are allowed to be on campus if we are ill. That is provincial and university policy. 

**If you need to self-isolate or take time off due to illness**, you are expected to inform me as soon as you can. No medical documentation is required, and I will not accept medical documentation of any kind. That is, please do not clog up the medical system by asking for a doctor’s note. This is also provincial and university policy. If you are unable to complete course work due to illness, then you need to let me know. If you expect to need more than two weeks off from completing any course work, you will need to ask for a formal concession or make arrangements with me to complete work. If you are able to complete course work while isolating, then you are expected to use the course site, watch videos, and participate in discussion forums.

## <a name="_toc142662826"></a>Statement on Generative AI
# You should not use any artificial intelligence tools when working on assignments for this class **unless your instructor has explicitly authorized their use**. In some cases, that “authorization” will be specified in assignment instructions. In some cases, you will get guidance in class or in an announcement in the Brightspace course site. If you’re ever unsure of whether it’s appropriate to use an artificial intelligence tool in an ATWP class to complete an assignment, **ask your instructor**. Please see the ATWP’s ATWP’s Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) tool guidelines for more info: <https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/atwp/current-students/ai-guidelines/index.php>.

## <a name="_toc142662827"></a>Communication
### <a name="_toc142662828"></a>Email

My preferred method of communication is email, especially for any official requests. You can reach me at **kastlev@uvic.ca** from ***Monday to Friday between 9am and 5pm (PST)***, and I’ll try to reply within 24 hours on weekdays. If you don’t hear back from me within this timeframe, please feel free to send a follow-up message. Though I check my account regularly, ***I do not monitor it as frequently during the evening or weekends***. That said, I will do my best to respond to e-mails received outside of normal working hours if the word “URGENT” appears in the subject line to indicate a time-sensitive matter. 

When emailing, please include a salutation, sign-off, full sentences, and a relevant subject line. These are some of the generic conventions of professional communication. Please be sure to identify yourself in the email with your name, course number, and section. This information is especially useful to make sure that I’m able to give prompt, accurate, and helpful replies. 

I look forward to chatting with you! 
### <a name="_toc142662829"></a>Office Hours
I will hold drop-in office hours Wednesdays from 1:30-2:30 in my office (CLE D272). I will meet individually with students on a first-come first-serve basis. ***If you’re unable to “drop in” to office hours or make an appointment, please email me and we will come up with an alternative meeting time that works for both of us.*** 

## <a name="_toc142662830"></a>Attendance

ATWP 135 course activities and assignments are designed in a scaffolded way, so missing class sessions will result in lack of preparation for important, marked projects. Regular attendance, coupled with informed and active participation during class, is a crucial factor in student success. It is also an important way to uphold your responsibility to your academic community, as we learn and produce knowledge together. Missing further classes puts you at risk of not passing the course. Therefore, I urge you to come to each class meeting.



If you do miss class for any reason, know that it is your responsibility to catch up. Your first step should be to access the course materials available on our BrightSpace course site. You might also ask another student in the class to share their notes. If you still have questions at that point, please send them to me by email, or stop by during my office hours. There are sometimes issues that make it impossible for a student to get to class, but there are ways to stay engaged even if you can’t attend every session.



However, it is important to stress that missing a lot of class sessions is correlated with difficulty completing assignments successfully. For that reason, I will try to support you in the following ways:

- I will take attendance in every class session;
- If you miss the equivalent of two weeks of class sessions (6 x 50-minute class sessions or 4 x 75-minute class sessions), I will contact you to check in about your plans for moving forward in the class;
- And if you miss the equivalent of three weeks of class sessions (9 x 50-minute class sessions or 6 x 75-minute class sessions), I will require you to have a meeting with me to talk about actions that might be appropriate (such as withdrawing from the course or submitting a Request for Academic Concession or meeting with an academic advisor).

To be clear, I don’t need a written explanation every time you miss class, much less formal documentation like a doctor’s note. I do ask that you let me know if you have reason to think you will be missing a lot of class meetings so that we can talk about your best options for completing this course successfully.

## <a name="_toc142662831"></a>Late Work and Extensions

Because we are emerging from a pandemic, I recognize the need for flexibility and accessibility. If you are unable to complete an assignment by the required due date, please reach out to me by email as soon as possible and we can discuss options. **Students who do not communicate with me about late work will have a penalty of 2% per day applied to the assignment grade for all major assignments (such as the Academic Summary, Persuading Skeptics Essay, or elements of the Research Paper).** In other words, if an assignment is 4 days late, that means 8% taken off. If the original grade was a B [75%], then the adjusted grade would be 67%. **Students who do not communicate with me about late work will be unable to submit late mini-assignments.** 

## <a name="_toc142662832"></a>Requests for Academic Concession
Students who cannot complete the Research Essay and/or the Portfolio (Final Assessment) by the end of term are advised to apply for an Academic Concession. Students who have not completed other required course work (Personal Literacy Narrative, Academic Summary, and Persuading Skeptics Assignment), in addition to the Research Essay and Portfolio, will need to apply for a late withdrawal. The course assignments are scaffolded and develop the skills and habits of mind necessary to be successful in postsecondary writing, and to meet course learning objectives; therefore, not completing assignments over the term means you have not gained these habits and not demonstrated achievement of learning objectives required to pass the course. If you have questions or concerns about this policy, please speak with your instructor, or contact the ATWP Director (<atwpdir@uvic.ca>).

## <a name="_toc142662833"></a>Missing Assignment Policy
Not submitting a required formal assignment *at all* will result in a grade of “N” or “incomplete” for the course; this is equivalent to a failing grade. 

For ATWP135, these required formal assignments include: 

- Assign. #1: Academic Summary
- Assign. #2: Persuading Skeptics
- Assign. #3: Peer Review, Draft and Thesis
- Assign. #4: Research Consultation
- Assign. #5: Research Paper
- Final Assessment: Portfolio

In other words, you must complete all of the above to pass the course.

That said, these are challenging and unusual times we are living in. If something comes up and you become ill, have to care for others, or get overwhelmed with work (school or other), please communicate your situation with me as soon as possible. 

## <a name="_toc142662834"></a>Syllabus Modifications
The course syllabus, encompassing both policies and procedures as well as the outline and schedule below, is a general plan for the course. Deviations may be necessary and will be announced to the class and distributed in writing by me. If I become ill over the term, the course will be covered by another instructor or the course coordinator. 

## <a name="_toc142662835"></a>Grading
The writing you do in ATWP135 will be evaluated according to the[` `*Academic and Technical Writing Program’s*](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/atwp/current-students/grading/index.php) grading standards for first-year academic writing. 

Your work will also be evaluated in terms of how well it meets the requirements of the assignment and your achievement of the learning objectives of the course.

## <a name="_toc142662836"></a>Grade Appeals
If you believe that an assignment you submitted has been unfairly evaluated, your first step is to discuss your concerns with the instructor. Since I am using the [grading standards for first-year writing](http://english.uvic.ca/undergrad/grading_standards.html), be prepared to show me how your work matches the standards for the letter grade you think you should have received. If you are not satisfied with this discussion, then [*you may apply for a formal grade review*.](https://www.uvic.ca/registrar/assets/docs/record-forms/grade-review.pdf) 

## <a name="_toc142662837"></a>Academic Honesty and Integrity Policy
The writing you do and submit for this class must be your own. Presenting the work of others as your own violates the university's policy on academic integrity. This includes:

- using work without proper attribution (plagiarism),
- submitting work written by someone else (cheating), 
- or producing work with inappropriate help (unauthorized editing).

The university has prepared several documents and resources to help you understand what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, and unauthorized editing; to help you comprehend this key policy; and to help you avoid any violations thereof.

- [*Plagiarism](https://www.uvic.ca/library/research/citation/plagiarism/index.php)* from the UVic Libraries website explains what plagiarism is and how to avoid it.
- The University of Victoria's Policy on Academic Integrity, from the [*academic calendar](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/undergrad/index.php#/policy/Sk_0xsM_V?bc=true&bcCurrent=08%20-%20Policy%20on%20Academic%20Integrity&bcGroup=Undergraduate%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies)*,* defines plagiarism and describes the university's procedures for dealing with allegations of plagiarism and the penalties.
- The [*University Ombudsperson*](https://uvicombudsperson.ca/tips/plagiarism/) offers an excellent discussion of how to prevent plagiarism.
- [Integrity Matters on](https://bright.uvic.ca/d2l/le/discovery/view/course/132610) Brightspace is a highly recommended series of self-paced modules that equips UVic undergraduates with the most relevant information.

Here are a few points about plagiarism to keep in mind when you write:

- The best way to avoid inadvertent plagiarism is to ask your instructor or a Centre for Academic Communication tutor for guidance when it comes to giving proper credit to your sources. Some students end up plagiarizing because they aren't sure how to correctly incorporate the work of others into their writing. Your instructor can help you learn how to quote, paraphrase, summarize, and cite your sources correctly.
- Students who are found guilty of plagiarism or cheating face serious consequences. According to the university policy, "A largely or fully plagiarized assignment should result in a grade of F for the course."
- If a student is found guilty of violating the university's policy on academic integrity, the offence will be added to the student's record and will remain there for four years after the student graduates.

Also, remember that all course content and materials are made available by instructors for educational purposes and for the exclusive use of students registered in their class. The material is protected under copyright law, even if not marked with a ©.  Any further use or distribution of materials to others requires the written permission of the instructor, [except under fair dealing or another exception in the Copyright Act](https://www.uvic.ca/library/featured/copyright/). Violations may result in disciplinary action under the [Resolution of Non-Academic Misconduct Allegations policy (AC1300)](https://www.uvic.ca/universitysecretary/assets/docs/policies/AC1300.pdf)**.**

Tri-Faculty Code of Professional Behaviour

Professionalism is expected from all students enrolled in courses in the Faculty of Humanities. As part of professionalism, students, faculty and staff are expected to be familiar with University policies, including the [Tri-Faculty’s *Standards for Professional Behaviour*.](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uvic.ca%2Fservices%2Fadvising%2Fadvice-support%2Facademic-units%2Fstudent-code-of-conduct%2Findex.php&data=05%7C01%7Ckastlev%40uvic.ca%7C6f6c96771960460a4a0108dba97aaf55%7C9c61d3779894427cb13b1d6a51662b4e%7C0%7C0%7C638290116642634259%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=G6BnWzVJVi9ZDLP94ivJqFCM%2B7Vdx9TwWUuZQ80nGA4%3D&reserved=0)


## <a name="_toc142662838"></a>Accessibility Statement  
Each student brings to this course diverse interests, learning styles, and needs. Accordingly, the assignments and activities in ATWP135 have been designed to draw upon a variety of different aptitudes and strengths. 

Ideally, the course aims for accessibility over accommodation. “Accommodation” means that you have to show or prove that you need something, and then an instructor tries to make sure that you get enough of what you need, whereas “accessibility” means that the course is designed to make it so that you don’t need to ask in the first place. That being said, communicating your personal learning needs early on in the term is immensely valuable and helps me to support you in many different ways. 

The sooner you discuss your learning needs in a way you’re comfortable doing so, the sooner I can assist you in achieving your learning goals in ways you can be proud of. So, if at any point in the term you find yourself prevented from fully accessing our online course or not getting the support you need, you are encouraged – though not required – to contact me by e-mail or to visit me during office hours to discuss ways to improve accessibility. As well, expect multiple anonymous opportunities for you to provide me with this kind of feedback as the term progresses (i.e. not only at the end of the course).

***If you are a person with a permanent disability, temporary disability, or health consideration*** that may require accommodations, you may approach me and/or the [*Centre for Accessible Learning (CAL)](https://www.uvic.ca/accessible-learning/index.php)*.* Note that CAL staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals, and arrange appropriate accommodations. To be clear, an accommodation is not the same as students needing “more” support; rather, it’s a matter of students needing different kinds of support.

UVic takes ***student** **mental health*** very seriously. Please review [*UVic’s Mental Health website*](https://www.uvic.ca/mentalhealth/) for more information. Available services for students include crisis and emergency mental health consultation and confidential assessment, counselling services (individual and small group), and referrals. Find out more information and book consultations directly via UVic’s [*Counselling services website](https://www.uvic.ca/services/counselling/)*.* As of Fall 2020, UVic is offering free, confidential mental health support for students via a 24/7 service called Support Connect ( https://www.uvic.ca/student-wellness/wellness-resources/supportconnect/index.php Get connected by phone and/or online with qualified counsellors, consultants, and life coaches anytime, anywhere. The province of British Columbia is now offering students free, 24/7 support through a program called [*Here2Talk](https://here2talk.ca/home)*.* To be very clear, I am not a counsellor; however, I’m always happy to get you more information and resources. 

Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or ***accessing sufficient food*** to eat every day, or who lacks a ***safe and stable place to live***, and believes this may affect their performance in ATWP135, is strongly encouraged to contact me. Resources you may find helpful include:

- UVic’s campus [*Food Bank and Free Store*](https://uvss.ca/foodbank/) is now offering students in need food hampers for pick-up. 
- [The Women in Need](http://www.womeninneed.ca/) website keeps an extensive, up-to-date list of places where anyone can get meals or groceries at no or low cost in the greater Victoria area.  
- The [*UVSS “Rent with Rights” campaign*](https://uvss.ca/rent-with-rights/) offers information about housing issues and resources.

## <a name="_toc142662839"></a>Sexualized Violence Prevention and Response at UVic
UVic takes sexualized violence seriously, and has raised the bar for what is considered acceptable behaviour. We encourage students to learn more about how the university defines sexualized violence and its overall approach by visiting [www.uvic.ca/svp](http://www.uvic.ca/svp). If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexualized violence and needs information, advice, and/or support please contact the sexualized violence resource office in Equity and Human Rights (EQHR). Whether or not you have been directly impacted, if you want to take part in the important prevention work taking place on campus, you can also reach out:

# <a name="_toc142662840"></a>Course Experience Survey (CES)
As the instructor, I value your feedback on this course. Towards the end of term, you will have the opportunity to complete a confidential Course Experience Survey (CES) regarding your learning experience. The survey is vital to providing feedback to me regarding the course and my teaching as well as to help improve the overall program for students in the future. 

When it is time for you to complete the survey, you will receive an email inviting you to do so. If you do not receive an email invitation, you can go directly to your [CES dashboard](Users/lorengaudet/Dropbox/Dropbox/UVic/ces.uvic.ca/uvic). You will need to use your UVic NetLink ID to access the survey, which can be done on your laptop, tablet, or mobile device. I will remind of this survey near the time when it becomes available, but please be thinking about this important activity, especially the following three questions, throughout the course.

1. What strengths did your **instructor** demonstrate that helped you learn in this course?
1. Please provide specific suggestions as to how the **instructor** could have helped you learn more effectively.
1. Please provide specific suggestions as to how this **course** could be improved.
# <a name="_toc142662841"></a>Additional Resources
In addition to any materials I provide, a number of resources are available to support your learning in ATWP135. The two you’re likely to consult most often are:

- **The Centre for Academic Communication: [*The Centre for Academic Communication*](https://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/cac/)** provides free, one-on-one, ethical tutoring to help students build their writing skills and proficiency in English. The CAC also runs workshops that address common problems in academic writing. This term, those services are available online. You can book tutoring appointments through the [*CAC website](https://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/cac/)*.*

- **UVic Libraries:** UVic Libraries staff members offer students help with their research, writing papers, locating resources, and identifying people to ask for more help. The [*Research Anywhere* ](https://libguides.uvic.ca/ResearchAnywhere)site provides access to your research needs and offers helpful tutorials. You can also [*contact librarians by chat, phone*](https://www.uvic.ca/library/research/ask/index.php) and other methods. Furthermore, friendly librarians can help you shape your research question and find and cite peer-reviewed articles for your essay.  You can make an appointment to meet with a librarian over Zoom or in person, at a time that works for you, via the [Libraries website](https://www.uvic.ca/library/help/librarians/book.php).

Check out the “Student Resources” section of our Brightspace site for links to more resources (both on campus and online).

**Other key policies** that you might want or need to know about are listed on the [*Student Services* website](C:\Users\doswald\Desktop\ https\www.uvic.ca\studentaffairs\home\policies\index.php). The goal is to make your experience at UVic safer, easier, and more enjoyable. Only some are directly related to ATWP135, but they’re all important.
