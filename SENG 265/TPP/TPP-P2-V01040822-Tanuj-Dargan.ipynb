    "The most popular programming languages today as per the [2024 Stackoverflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology) include Python, JavaScript, Typescript, Java, C, and C++. Python is favored for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive libraries, making it ideal for data science, machine learning, and web development. JavaScript dominates web development due to its ability to create interactive frontends and backends. Java is widely used for enterprise applications and Android development because of its stability and scalability. C and C++ are essential for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications due to their speed and low-level control. These languages remain popular because they address diverse needs across industries and have strong community support.\n",

It helps catch errors early, improving the reliability of my projects. As for Rust, I believe companies are excited about it because it offers memory safety without the overhead of a garbage collector. It can potentially replace performance-critical parts of Python applications, which is a big deal when scaling. Rust has a strong type system, and while typing is part of its appeal, I think the real magic is in how Rust manages memory safely through ownership and borrowing, which appeals to organizations that need both speed and safety. The safe memory mangement also makes it a noteable replacement for C/C++ given its performance compared to python.\n",

Although comprehensions and slicing can replace a lot of simple loops, I can’t do absolutely everything with them (for instance, loops that involve multiple complex steps, external function calls, or intricate branching logic might be more readable in an explicit loop).

I enjoy using PyTorch because it feels intuitive for creating and training neural networks for deep learning. It uses a dynamic computational graph, so I can experiment and debug my models as I go without a lot of boilerplate code. PyTorch is backed by a huge community, and I find plenty of tutorials and ready-made components to jumpstart my machine learning projects. It’s also great for research-level projects where I need maximum flexibility and frequent changes to model architectures. \n",

OpenCV is my go-to for computer vision tasks. I like it because it has a wealth of pre-built tools for image manipulation, object detection, and more advanced features like facial recognition. Whenever I need to process large batches of images, create visual effects, or prototype something like a gesture-control system, OpenCV’s performance and breadth of features come in handy. It saves me from having to reinvent the wheel for most classic computer vision algorithms.  \n",

Flask is often used for small to medium-sized projects or as a backend for APIs. For lightweight web applications and APIs, Flask is fantastic. It’s a micro-framework, so I can keep my application structure simple—perfect for smaller projects or quick prototypes. At the same time, Flask is so flexible that I can scale up and add extensions for databases, authentication, or session management if I need them. I love how little overhead it imposes, letting me focus on core functionality first. \n",

When I want to turn a data project or machine learning prototype into a shareable web app fast, Streamlit is my best friend. I can write a few lines of Python, use Streamlit’s built-in components for sliders or text fields, and have an interactive dashboard running almost instantly. It’s especially useful if I need to show stakeholders a visual demo of my model predictions or data transformations—no need to write front-end code or learn a more complex web framework. \n",

    "## 19. [Required] How did you experience Generative AI (e.g., chatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, or Copilot) as a learning tool? This answer must be different from what you answered in TPP1 (i.e., the assumption is that you got to know genAI tools better in the first part of the course and you really used it in the second part of the course).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second half of the course, I began to see GenAI tools as active collaborators. Instead of just searching for quick answers, I used them to brainstorm approaches or debug tricky errors in smaller code snippets. I also learned to be more skeptical and verify the suggestions I got from AI. That shift from passive consumption to thoughtful collaboration was a big deal for me, and it made me feel more in charge of how I use these tools. I began to use AI integrated IDE's like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) that offer a way more intuitive experience with LLM's to help me debug my code and manage proper documentation in case anything is misrepresented or doesnt match PEP8 and other standards.\n",

    "\n",
    "One of my biggest insights was how quickly minor mistakes in C can lead to major debugging headaches. That taught me the value of writing robust tests and carefully thinking about memory usage. Another aha moment was realizing how much faster I could develop certain features in Python compared to a lower-level language. Finally, I had an epiphany about the value of clarity in communication—both in code (through logging, comments, or docstrings) and in asking questions whenever requirements were unclear.\n",
