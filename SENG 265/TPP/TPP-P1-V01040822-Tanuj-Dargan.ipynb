JavaScript dominates web development due to its ability to create interactive frontends and backends. Java is widely used for enterprise applications and Android development because of its stability and scalability. C and C++ are essential for systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications due to their speed and low-level control. These languages remain popular because they address diverse needs across industries and have strong community support.\n",

    "\n",
    "Learning C and Python in SENG 265 is incredibly beneficial for your software development career. C provides a strong foundation in low-level programming, memory management, and performance optimization, which are critical for systems programming and embedded systems. Python, on the other hand, is versatile and widely used in fields like data science, machine learning, and web development. Mastering both languages equips you with a diverse skill set, enabling you to tackle a wide range of projects and making you highly competitive in the software development industry.\n",

    "C and Python differ fundamentally in their design and use cases. C is a low-level, statically typed, compiled language that provides fine-grained control over memory and system resources, making it ideal for systems programming and performance-critical applications. Python, on the other hand, is a high-level, dynamically typed, interpreted language known for its simplicity and extensive libraries, making it perfect for rapid development, data science, and automation. While C prioritizes performance and efficiency, Python emphasizes ease of use and developer productivity. Both are powerful tools, excelling in different domains of software development.\n",

    "\n",
    "Learning C was slightly difficult for me initially because its syntax and manual memory management are quite different from higher-level languages like Python. However, I found it rewarding as it gave me a deeper understanding of how computers work at a low level. Working on projects like developing sensor systems for the UVic Formula Hybrid car using C helped me appreciate its power and efficiency, making the learning process worthwhile.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the first part of SENG 265, I had several insights and \"aha\" moments that deepened my understanding of programming and problem-solving. One key realization was how foundational concepts like memory management and pointers in C provide a deeper understanding of how computers operate at a low level. This was an eye-opener, as I had previously relied on higher-level languages like Python, which abstract these details. Another epiphany came when I successfully debugged a segmentation fault for the first time—it taught me the importance of careful memory handling and how small mistakes can have significant consequences. Additionally, learning to write efficient, concise code in C helped me appreciate the balance between performance and readability. These moments not only enhanced my technical skills but also shifted my perspective on programming, making me more detail-oriented and methodical in my approach.\n",

    "I found GenAI tools, particularly Claude, to be incredibly helpful as learning aids during the course. Claude provided clear explanations of complex concepts, helped debug code, and offered alternative approaches to solving problems. It was especially useful when I struggled with C syntax or debugging errors, as it provided step-by-step guidance that enhanced my understanding. Unlike static resources, Claude’s interactive nature allowed me to ask follow-up questions and refine my learning process. It acted as a supportive tutor, helping me bridge gaps in my knowledge and boosting my confidence in tackling assignments. Overall, using Claude made learning more efficient and engaging.\n",
